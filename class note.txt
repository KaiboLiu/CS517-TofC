In mathematics, the power set (or powerset) of any set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself, variously denoted as P(S)

Cantor's theorem
edge case: 
X=empty: |X|=0
P(X)={empty}: |P(X)|=1

Throrem: no surjective function f: X -> P(X)
One-line proof:....
detailed: â†˜
idea: take f: X->P(X)
each f(x) in P(X) => f(x) is subset of X
write f as table
f(x1)={x2,x3,...}
f(x2)=empty
f(x3)={x1}

is xj in f(xi)?

Obs: f is onto f
every sequence of 0/1 appears somewhere as a Row in this table
Claim: complemented diagonal disagrees with every Row of table
disagrees with nth row in (at least) nth position
